    <!-- About -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2><span class="blue">About</span> {</h2>
            <p>         
                This project followed the waterfall software development approach, involving key steps such as stakeholder meetings, requirements gathering, developing class and sequence diagrams, designing a test plan, and, ultimately, building the final product.
                <br><br>
                This project was completed over four weeks, with the first two weeks dedicated to meeting stakeholder requirements and the remaining two weeks focused on building the system.
                <br><br>
                The final product was a grading calculator, thoughtfully designed to meet the specific requirements of the stakeholders.            </p>
        <h2>}</h2>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Stage 1: Requirements -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2><span class="blue">Stage 1 </span> (<span class="orange">Requirements</span>, <span class="yellow">Week 1</span>) {</h2>
            <p>    
                In this stage, I met with stakeholders to discuss their precise requirements for the system. The key requirements identified were:
                <ul>
                    <li class="requirements">The user can input multiple categories, and assignments within those categories</li>
                    <li class="requirements">The user can input multiple courses</li>
                    <li class="requirements">The user can reload previously saved data</li>
                    <li class="requirements">The user can dictate rounding criteria</li>
                </ul> 
            </p>
        <h2>}</h2>
    </div> 

    <!-- Stage 2: Class Diagram -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2><span class="blue">Stage 2 </span> (<span class="orange">Class Diagram</span>, <span class="yellow">Week 1</span>) {</h2>
            <p>    
                This stage focused on developing a class diagram to guide the functionality of the project, ensuring it aligned with the stakeholders’ requirements.
                <br><br>
                This class diagram was created using Lucid Chart.
            </p>

    <!-- Stage 3: Sequence Diagrams -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2><span class="blue">Stage 3 </span> (<span class="orange">Sequence Diagrams</span>, <span class="yellow">Week 2</span>) {</h2>
            <p>    
                In this stage, I created sequence diagrams to outline the flow of events for each specific requirement, ensuring they adhered to the stakeholders’ expectations.
                <br><br>
                These sequence diagrams were created using Lucid Chart.
            </p>

    </div>

    <!-- Stage 4: Test Plan -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2><span class="blue">Stage 4 </span> (<span class="orange">Test Plan</span>, <span class="yellow">Week 2</span>) {</h2>
            <p>
                This stage involved developing test cases for each stakeholder requirement. Each test case included sections for the associated requirement, prerequisites, a detailed procedure, the expected outcome, pass criteria, and a summary.
            </p>
        <h2>}</h2>
    </div> 

    <!-- Stage 5: Create the Product -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2><span class="blue">Stage 5 </span> (<span class="orange">Create the Product</span>, <span class="yellow">Week 3</span>, <span class="yellow">Week 4</span>) {</h2>
            <p> 
                This stage centered on building the project in alignment with stakeholder requirements, as well as the established class and sequence diagrams.
