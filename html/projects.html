    <h2 id="databases"><span class="blue">Compilers Project</span> {</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="comment">// This project was completed May 2025</span><br>
        This project involved building a complete compiler in Java for CatScript, a statically typed, JavaScript / Python inspired scripting language. Developed all major compiler components, including lexical analysis, recursive descent parsing, sematnic analysis, and JVM bytecode generation for runtime execution. Collaborated in a team setting, contributing test cases, language documentation, and peer reviews.
